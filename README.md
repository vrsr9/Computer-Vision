Computer Vision - Image Classification using CNN in Keras 


##### Data Description:
    You are provided with a datasetof  images of  plant seedlings at various stages of  grown.  Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset            comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the projectis to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.
##### Dataset:
     The data file names are:  
             images.npy
             Label.csv 
     The original files are from Kaggle. Due to the large volume of data, the images were converted to images.npy file and the labels are  also  put  into  the          Labels.csv.  So  that  you  can  work  on  the  data/project  seamlessly without  worrying  about  the  high  data volume.
